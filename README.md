# Windmill

## Features to be implemented:

- [ ] Tie current momentum with sensitivity for turning midair
- [X] Create a jump boost that gives either momentum or a straight vertical boost
- [X] Switch flight mode to a hold feature on shift

## Controls:
- press `o` to see a few metrics.
 - when you jump, you can hold `left shift` to open your wings.

 ### While your wings are open
 - hold `s` while your wings are open to slow down.
 - Press `space` to gain a boost of momentum.
